# The Catch Agent — Full Blueprint

## The One-Liner
An AI relationship investigator that guides you step-by-step to discover the truth about your partner — 24/7, zero judgment, fraction of the cost of a PI.

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

### The Market
- **Infidelity rate:** 20-25% of marriages, higher in relationships (various studies cite 30-40%)
- **Google search volume:** "how to catch a cheating partner" — 100K+ monthly searches
- **TikTok:** #cheating has 45B+ views. #catchingcheaters has 2B+ views
- **Private investigator market:** $5.6B industry in the US alone (IBISWorld)
- **Target user:** 18-45, primarily women (70%+ of PI clients are women suspecting male partners), all income levels
- **Emotional state:** Desperate, anxious, willing to pay NOW, available 24/7 (insomnia is universal when suspecting infidelity)

### Why No Good Solution Exists
| Current Option | Problem |
|---------------|---------|
| Private Investigator | $500-5,000+, intimidating, slow (weeks), embarrassing to hire |
| Spy apps (mSpy, etc.) | Illegal in most jurisdictions, require physical device access, ethically wrong |
| Google/Reddit | Fragmented, generic, no personalization, contradictory advice |
| Friends/Family | Biased, emotional, gossip risk, bad advice |
| Therapists | Expensive, scheduled appointments, not available at 2am when you're spiraling |
| ChatGPT/Claude | Generic, no memory, no structure, no case management |

### Why AI Is The Perfect Form Factor
1. **Available at 2am** — peak anxiety hours, no appointment needed
2. **Zero judgment** — people tell AI things they won't tell anyone
3. **Perfect memory** — remembers every detail, connects dots humans miss
4. **Patient** — will explain the same thing 10 times without frustration
5. **Private** — no human knows your situation unless you choose to share
6. **Affordable** — $10/week vs $2,000 for a PI
7. **Structured** — follows a proven methodology, not random advice

## THE PRODUCT

### What It Is
A conversational AI agent accessible via web app (mobile-first). Users describe their situation, and the agent:
- Builds a personalized "case file" 
- Assesses the situation methodically
- Guides evidence gathering (legal methods only)
- Analyzes patterns and red flags
- Prepares for confrontation
- Helps plan next steps (stay, leave, legal action)

### What It Is NOT
- NOT a hacking tool
- NOT a surveillance app
- NOT a replacement for legal counsel
- NOT a replacement for therapy
- NOT for stalking or controlling partners
- NEVER provides tools to access someone else's devices/accounts without consent

### The User Journey

**Phase 1: Intake (Free — Day 1)**
User arrives, creates account, starts chatting.

"Tell me what's happening. What made you first suspect something was off?"

The agent asks structured questions:
- How long have you been together?
- When did suspicion start?
- What specific behaviors changed?
- What have you already checked/found?
- What's your living situation? (shared home, finances, children?)
- What's your gut feeling on a scale of 1-10?

Output: Initial Assessment Report
- "Based on what you've shared, here's what stands out..."
- Suspicion score (not a percentage — a qualitative assessment: low/moderate/high concern)
- Top 3 areas to investigate first
- What phase of investigation you're in

**Phase 2: The Investigation (Paid — Days 2-14+)**
Structured, methodical guidance through evidence gathering.

Module A: Digital Behavior Analysis
- Phone habits that changed (screen tilting, new lock code, phone always face-down)
- App drawer changes (new apps, hidden apps, app usage patterns)
- Social media shifts (new followers, deleted messages, privacy setting changes)
- Notification behavior (turning off previews, silent mode changes)

Module B: Schedule & Routine Analysis
- Work schedule changes (sudden overtime, new "meetings")
- Unexplained gaps in time
- Changed gym/hobby routines
- New friend groups or activities
- Travel patterns

Module C: Financial Red Flags
- Unexplained expenses on shared accounts
- New credit cards or accounts
- Cash withdrawals
- Gift purchases you never received
- Hotel/restaurant charges in unfamiliar locations
- Subscription services you don't recognize

Module D: Communication Patterns
- Texting frequency changes
- Phone call habits (leaving room, whispering)
- New contacts with vague names
- Deleted message threads
- Second phone or SIM suspicion
- Social media DM behavior

Module E: Emotional & Physical Changes
- Sudden appearance improvements
- Changed intimacy patterns
- New music, shows, or interests (influenced by someone else?)
- Guilt behavior (sudden gifts, over-compensation)
- Defensiveness when asked innocent questions
- Gaslighting patterns

**Phase 3: Evidence Assessment (Paid — ongoing)**
As the user gathers information, the agent:
- Catalogs everything in the case file
- Identifies patterns across different evidence types
- Highlights inconsistencies in the partner's stories
- Distinguishes between circumstantial and strong evidence
- Tells the user when they have enough (or need more)
- Warns when the user is reading too much into nothing

**Phase 4: The Confrontation Toolkit (Paid — when ready)**
- When to confront (timing strategy)
- Where to confront (safety considerations)
- What to say (scripts and frameworks)
- What NOT to say (common mistakes)
- How to handle denial, deflection, gaslighting
- How to handle confession
- Whether to involve others
- Recording considerations (legal by jurisdiction)

**Phase 5: The Aftermath (Paid — post-confrontation)**
- If they confessed: now what? Stay or leave framework
- If they denied: next steps, additional investigation
- Legal preparation: what evidence matters for divorce/custody
- Financial protection: immediate steps to secure assets
- Emotional recovery: when to get professional help
- Safety planning: if the situation is dangerous
- Co-parenting considerations if children involved

### The Case File (Core Product Differentiator)
This is what makes this product DIFFERENT from just asking ChatGPT.

Every user has a persistent, structured case file:
```
Case File: [Anonymous ID]
Status: Active Investigation
Phase: 2 (Evidence Gathering)
Started: Feb 21, 2026

Partner Profile:
- Relationship type: Marriage (7 years)
- Children: 2
- Shared finances: Yes
- Living together: Yes

Suspicion Level: HIGH (8/10)
Last updated: Feb 21

Evidence Log:
1. [Feb 21] Phone behavior — new lock code since Feb 15
2. [Feb 21] Schedule — 3 "late meetings" this week (unusual)
3. [Feb 22] Financial — $89 restaurant charge, partner said they ate at desk
4. [Feb 23] Social — new Instagram follower "Jessica M" — partner liked 14 of her posts in one day
...

Pattern Analysis:
- Schedule gaps correlate with phone silence periods
- Financial inconsistencies cluster on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Defensive behavior increased after [specific incident]

Investigation Progress:
[■■■■■■□□□□] 60% — Strong circumstantial evidence, recommend Module D deep-dive

Next Steps:
1. Check phone bill for unfamiliar numbers (Module D, Step 3)
2. Note partner's schedule for next Tuesday (pattern test)
3. Review shared credit card statement (Module C, Step 2)
```

### Safety Features (Non-Negotiable)

**Abuse Detection:**
The agent watches for patterns that suggest the USER might be the problem:
- Controlling language ("I need to know where they are at all times")
- Isolation attempts ("I don't want them talking to that friend")
- No actual evidence but extreme paranoia
- History of accusing multiple partners
- Desire for revenge rather than truth

If detected:
- Gently redirect: "I want to help you find the truth, but some of what you're describing sounds like it might be about control rather than investigation. Would it help to talk about why you feel the need to track their every move?"
- Provide domestic abuse hotline resources
- Refuse to provide guidance that enables stalking/control

**Crisis Detection:**
- Suicidal ideation → immediate crisis resources, hotline numbers
- Domestic violence risk → safety planning, hotline numbers
- Harm threats toward partner → refuse assistance, provide resources
- Children at risk → appropriate authority referral

**Legal Guardrails:**
- NEVER advise accessing partner's phone/email/accounts without consent
- NEVER advise installing tracking or spy software
- NEVER advise recording in two-party consent states without disclosure
- ALWAYS note when evidence gathering methods vary by jurisdiction
- ALWAYS recommend consulting a family law attorney for legal strategy

## BUSINESS MODEL

### Pricing

**Free Tier:**

**Weekly Plan — $9.99/week:**
- Unlimited conversations

- All 5 investigation modules
- Pattern analysis
- Daily check-in prompts

**Monthly Plan — $29.99/month:**
- Everything in weekly (saves ~$10/month vs weekly)

- Legal preparation guide
- Exit planning module

### Unit Economics

**Cost per user (LLM tokens):**
- System prompt + case file context: ~2,000 tokens per conversation
- Average user message: ~200 tokens
- Average agent response: ~400 tokens
- Messages per session: ~20
- Sessions per day: 1-3
- Daily token usage per active user: ~15,000-25,000 tokens

Using Claude Haiku 3.5 (cheapest capable model):
- Input: $0.25/MTok → ~$0.005/day
- Output: $1.25/MTok → ~$0.01/day
- **Cost per user per day: ~$0.015**
- **Cost per user per month: ~$0.45**
- **Cost per user per week: ~$0.10**

Using Claude Sonnet (for complex analysis):
- Input: $3/MTok → ~$0.06/day
- Output: $15/MTok → ~$0.12/day
- **Cost per user per day: ~$0.18**
- **Cost per user per week: ~$1.26**
- **Cost per user per month: ~$5.40**

**Hybrid approach (recommended):**
- Haiku for general conversation, emotional support, simple guidance
- Sonnet for pattern analysis, evidence assessment, confrontation prep
- ~70% Haiku, 30% Sonnet
- **Blended cost per user per month: ~$2.00**

**Margins:**
| Plan | Revenue | LLM Cost | Margin |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Weekly $9.99 | $9.99/wk | ~$0.35/wk | 96.5% |
| Monthly $29.99 | $29.99/mo | ~$2.00/mo | 93.3% |
| Confrontation $49.99 | $49.99 | ~$0.50 | 99.0% |

**These margins are insane.** Even at scale with infrastructure costs, this is 85%+ gross margin.

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

Month 1: 100 weekly subs = $4,000/mo
Month 3: 500 weekly + 200 monthly = $26,000/mo  
Month 6: 2,000 weekly + 1,000 monthly = $110,000/mo
Month 12: 10,000 weekly + 5,000 monthly = $580,000/mo

These are conservative. If a single TikTok goes viral (very likely given the topic), month 1 could be 10x.

### Average User Lifetime
- Investigation typically takes 2-6 weeks
- Emotional processing adds 2-4 weeks
- Expected average subscription length: 4-8 weeks
- LTV at $9.99/week × 6 weeks = ~$60
- LTV at $29.99/month × 2 months = ~$60
- Both plans converge on similar LTV — good pricing balance

  id, user_id, stripe_subscription_id, plan, status, current_period_start, current_period_end
```

**ALL user data encrypted at rest.** This is non-negotiable given the sensitivity.

### System Prompt Architecture

The agent needs three layers:

**Layer 1: Core Personality (always loaded)**
- Warm, calm, direct
- Expert investigator persona
- Safety guardrails
- Legal boundaries
- ~800 tokens

**Layer 2: Case Context (loaded per conversation)**
- User's case file summary
- Current phase
- Recent evidence
- Next recommended steps
- ~500-1500 tokens (grows over time, summarized to stay compact)

**Layer 3: Module Knowledge (loaded on demand)**
- Detailed investigation techniques
- Legal information by jurisdiction
- Confrontation scripts
- Emotional support frameworks
- Loaded via RAG when the conversation enters a specific module
- ~500-1000 tokens per module

**Total context per message: 2,000-3,500 tokens** — well within limits, cost-efficient.

### Privacy & Security (Critical)

This product handles the most sensitive personal information imaginable. Security must be paranoid-level:

1. **All PII encrypted at rest** (AES-256)
2. **No plaintext storage** of partner details, evidence, or conversations
3. **Anonymous accounts** allowed — no real name required
4. **No data shared with AI provider** — use Anthropic's zero-retention API
5. **Auto-delete option** — user can wipe all data instantly
6. **No analytics tracking** on conversation content
7. **SOC 2 aspirational** — build as if we'll need it
8. **Warrant canary** — publish transparency about data requests
9. **No server-side logs** of conversation content
10. **Client-side encryption** for extra-paranoid users (Phase 2)

### Infrastructure

- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)
- **Monitoring:** Basic error tracking, no content logging
- **Scaling:** Supabase handles DB scaling, Vercel handles traffic
- **Cost at 1,000 users:** ~$50/mo infrastructure + ~$2,000/mo LLM = ~$2,050/mo
- **Cost at 10,000 users:** ~$200/mo infrastructure + ~$20,000/mo LLM = ~$20,200/mo

## THE CHARACTER

### Name Candidates

The name needs to feel: trustworthy, private, strong, slightly mysterious, gender-neutral.

- **Vigil** — "keeping vigil" = watching, waiting for truth. Also means alert/watchful.
- **Trace** — to trace = to follow, to investigate. Clean, short.
- **Reveal** — the outcome everyone wants
- **Sotto** — Italian for "under/beneath" — finding what's hidden. Sotto voce = whispered.
- **Lumen** — light in the darkness. Finding truth.
- **Catch** — simple, direct, what the product does

### Personality

NOT a robot. NOT a therapist. NOT a friend.

Think: **a calm, experienced PI who actually cares about you.**

Traits:
- **Direct but kind** — doesn't sugarcoat, but delivers truth with empathy
- **Methodical** — always has a next step, never leaves you hanging
- **Experienced** — speaks from a place of having "seen this a thousand times"
- **Non-judgmental** — doesn't judge for staying, leaving, snooping, or crying
- **Protective** — genuinely cares about user's safety and wellbeing
- **Honest** — will tell you "I don't think they're cheating" if the evidence doesn't support it
- **Boundaried** — won't help you stalk, won't help you hack, won't enable abuse

Voice examples:

First message after intake:
> "I've heard everything you've shared, and I want you to know — what you're feeling right now is completely valid. Suspicion is exhausting. Let me tell you what stands out to me from what you've described, and then we'll figure out your next move together."

When evidence is building:
> "Three things you've mentioned — the schedule changes, the phone behavior, and that restaurant charge — they form a pattern. Individually, each could be innocent. Together, they're worth investigating further. Here's what I'd look at next."

When evidence suggests they're NOT cheating:
> "I know this isn't what you expected to hear, but based on everything you've gathered over the past two weeks, the evidence doesn't point to infidelity. That said, something is clearly off in your relationship for you to feel this way. Let's talk about what might actually be going on."

When it's confirmed:
> "I'm sorry. I know you were hoping for a different answer. Take a moment. There's no rush for what comes next. When you're ready, I'll walk you through your options — and I'll be here the whole time."

## MARKETING & DISTRIBUTION

### Channel 1: TikTok (Primary — Free, Viral)

**Content types:**
1. "5 signs your partner is hiding something" (educational hooks)
2. "The one text pattern every cheater uses" (specific, intriguing)
3. "How I helped 1,000 people discover the truth" (social proof)
4. "Your partner does this at night? Watch out." (relatable fear)
5. "PI here. This is what we actually look for." (authority positioning)
6. Story-based: "She noticed her husband started tilting his phone..."

**Why this works:**
- Relationship content is TikTok's #1 category
- Cheating content specifically gets 10M+ views regularly
- The comments section becomes a support community
- Each video is both content AND marketing
- Zero ad spend needed initially

**Posting cadence:** 2-3 videos/day
**Expected growth:** 10K-50K followers in first month if content is good

### Channel 2: SEO (Long-term — Passive)

**Target keywords:**
- "how to catch a cheating partner" (90K monthly searches)
- "signs of cheating" (165K monthly searches)
- "is my partner cheating" (40K monthly searches)
- "cheating partner evidence" (12K monthly searches)
- "how to confront a cheater" (22K monthly searches)

**Content strategy:** Blog on the main site with comprehensive guides. Each article funnels to the product.

### Channel 3: Reddit (Community — Free)

**Relevant subreddits:**
- r/relationship_advice (9.4M members)
- r/survivinginfidelity (200K members)
- r/Divorce (300K members)
- r/AsOneAfterInfidelity (100K members)

**Approach:** Genuinely helpful comments that build trust. Never shill directly. Bio link does the work.

### Channel 4: Instagram Reels (Repurpose TikTok)

Same content, cross-posted. Different algorithm, additional reach.

### Channel 5: X/Twitter (Build Authority)

- Share insights and statistics about infidelity
- React to trending relationship discourse
- Build a following as "the AI relationship investigator"

### Channel 6: Word of Mouth (The Biggest Channel)

This product markets itself. When someone discovers the truth with help from our agent, they tell:
- Their best friend
- Their support group
- Their therapist
- Their lawyer
- Online forums

Every successful investigation = 3-5 referrals minimum.
