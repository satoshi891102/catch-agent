## Script 2: "2AM Conversations"
**Format:** Talking head, low light (bedroom aesthetic)
**Duration:** 30s
**Hook:** "It's 2am and you can't sleep because something feels off..."

Script:
"It's 2am. You can't sleep. Something feels off but you can't prove it.

You don't want to tell your friends — they'll either overreact or tell you you're crazy.

You can't afford a private investigator. Therapy is booked two weeks out.

Google just gives you contradictory Reddit threads.

So I built something. An AI investigator that's available at 2am. That remembers everything you tell it. That actually helps you figure out if your gut is right.

It's called Vigil. It's free to start. And it won't judge you.

Link in bio."

**Caption:** "Built this after watching too many people spiral alone at 2am 💔 #vigil #ai #relationships #cheating #2am"

## Script 3: "The Pattern Nobody Talks About"
**Format:** Green screen with bullet points
**Duration:** 20s
**Hook:** "The #1 pattern that proves cheating — and it's NOT what you think"

Script:
"Everyone looks for lipstick on the collar. That's TV.

Real cheating has a different pattern:

They start going to the gym — but they never went before.
Their phone gets a new password — 'for work security.'
They're suddenly working late on Tuesdays — every Tuesday.
They buy you random gifts — out of nowhere.

Individually? Each one is explainable.
Together? That's a pattern.

I built an AI that connects these dots for you. It's called Vigil. Free to try."

**Caption:** "Individual signs mean nothing. Patterns mean everything. 🔍 #cheatingpatterns #redflag #vigil"

## Script 6: "Storytime Format"
**Format:** Talking head, storytime
**Duration:** 60s
**Hook:** "I built an AI because of what happened to my friend..."

Script:
"So my friend was going through it. She KNEW something was wrong but couldn't prove it.

She'd ask me at midnight — 'am I crazy?' And I'd say no, but I didn't know how to help her organize her thoughts.

She'd find one thing — a weird charge on his card. Then forget about it. Then find another thing — him being 'at the gym' when the gym was closed. But she never connected the dots.

By the time she confronted him, she was so emotional he turned it around on HER. Made HER the problem.

That's when I thought — what if there was something that could organize all of this? Track the patterns? Prepare you for the conversation?

So I built Vigil. An AI that does exactly that. It's free to start. And it doesn't forget.

Link in bio if you need it — or save this for someone who does."

**Caption:** "Built this for everyone going through it alone 💛 #vigil #cheating #storytime #ai"

## Script 8: "The Gaslighting Response"
**Format:** Text messages mockup
**Duration:** 20s

"You're being paranoid"
"Why are you going through my stuff"
"You need to trust me"
"You're the one with the problem"
"I can't believe you'd accuse me"

Then: "That's not defense. That's deflection."

"Vigil recognizes these patterns. And it prepares you for them."

**Caption:** "Gaslighting is a pattern, not a one-time thing. 🔍 #gaslighting #narcissist #vigil"
